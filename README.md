## Introduction

A library of efficient survival analysis models, including DeepCox, HitBoost and EfnBoost methods.

- `DeepCox`: Deep cox proportional hazard model implemented by tensorflow.
- `HitBoost`: Survival analysis via a multi-output gradient boosting decision tree method.
- `EfnBoost`: Optimized cox proportional hazard model via an objective function of Efron approximation.

## Usage

Usage of `DeepCox`, `EfnBoost` and `HitBoost` are provided in [Jupyter Notebooks](examples/).
