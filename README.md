# libsurv

A library of survival model, including `DeepCox`, `EfnBoost` and `HitBoost` model.

- `DeepCox`: Deep cox proportional hazard model implemented by tensorflow.
- `HitBoost`: Survival Analysis via a Multi-output Gradient Boosting Decision Tree method.
- `EfnBoost`: Optimized cox proportional hazard XGBoost model via an objective function of Efron approximation.
